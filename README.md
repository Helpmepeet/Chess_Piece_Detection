# Chess Piece Detection with YOLO

This project uses computer vision to detect chess pieces and their positions on a board. It was developed using a YOLO object detection model and trained on a custom dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal is to recognize different types of chess pieces on a real chessboard from images. The final output includes bounding boxes and labels for each detected piece.

## Model and Tools

- YOLOv5 model trained with Roboflow dataset
- Used Google Colab Pro for training
- Handled image annotations and data preparation with Roboflow

## Libraries

- Python
- PyTorch
- YOLOv5
- OpenCV
- Roboflow SDK

## Files

- `chess_piece_detection.ipynb` — main notebook with training, prediction, and visualization
